## 1 Introduction

This document portrays Team 10's project plan for the delivery of a Vocabulary Quiz App. This app will help students study vocabulary terms for their classes by allowing users to practice a quiz and challenge one another by allowing them to create new quizzes.

## 2 Process Description

### Inception Phase

**Description**

Inception phase involved working on preliminary project schedule and team estimates. We defined the scope of requirements and provided rough estimates for the project. We also built our ProjectPlan document.

**Entrance Criteria**
- The initial requirements provided by the client for "Vocabulary Quiz App".
- Resources - organization of Team 10 as a development team.
- Required hardware and softwares resources.

**Exit Criteria**

*Deliverables*
- ProjectPlan.md

*Success Criteria*
- Well-defined realistic project plan.

### Elaboration Phase

**Description**

In Elaboration phase we modeled classes and created a UML class diagram. We also created a low-level DesignDocument which included UI mockups. Based on team discussion we arrived at the conclusion of project timelines and deliverables. We refined requirements by iterating through the requirements a few times to gain clarity. Further we created a test plan, which involved documenting our testing strategy along with test suites and test cases.

**Entrance Criteria**
- High level design
- Project Vision
- Resources - Team 10

**Exit Criteria**

*Deliverables*
- ExtraRequirments - ExtraRequirments markdown document.
- Architecture & low-level design - DesignDocument markdown document.
- Written pseudocode.
- Test cases without results - TestPlan markdown document.
- Revised project plan - ProjectPlan markdown document.

*Success Criteria*
- Team members are in agreement.
- All the user requirements are captured in the deliverables.
- Design is implementable and meets the client expectations.
- User experience is simple and straighforward.
- Test cases successfully capture the details of the requirements.
- Vision and architecture stability.
- Project plan adheres to a high level of detail and accuracy.

### Construction Phase

**Description**

The Construction phase starts with the development of code which aligns with the design document. It further involves the generation of unit tests. Written unit tests will be evaluated against code metrics and test plans will be updated with actual results. Finally, based on the results of our tests, we will resolve any bugs identified during the testing process. Once bugs are resolved and retested, we will perform integration testing on multiple android devices.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project artifacts - deliverables from the Elaboration phase.
- Resources - Team 10.

**Exit Criteria**

- Testing signoff.
- Check-in final version of code in a version control system.
- Finished product.
- Deployment package.

*Deliverables*

- Finished product.

*Success Criteria*

- Product stability is suitable for deployment to users.

### Transition Phase

**Description**

The Transition phase involves deployment of the product to the user community. This phase includes maintenance of the product as well.  Maintenance items can be reported as either bugs, enhancements, or environment changes. All maintenance (whether it involves fixing bugs, making enhancements, or adapting to a new environment) will ultimately result in a new release version of product.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Testing signoff.
- Demo to Stakeholders.
- Deployment package.
- Resources - Team 10.

**Exit Criteria**
- Client approval of the finished product.

*Deliverables*
- RTM.
- User Manual.
- Release notes.
- Product releases on adequate platforms - android.
- Test summary.

*Success Criteria*

- Successful product distribution.
- Client approvals
